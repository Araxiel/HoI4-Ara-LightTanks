This tiny mod gives all [b]Light Armoured Brigades[/b] a bit more usefulness, for extra immersion, realism and historical accuracy.

Light tanks are really underwhelming, especially in the later stages of the war. Now in some ways that does make perfect sense; there is somewhat of a reason why Panzer-II's and Stuarts didn't assume the role of main battle tanks in 1945.
That said, light tanks have their advantages. One of which is afterall their size and their speed. Now in real-life, the armies of WW2 decided to rather use armored cars such as the AEC Armoured Car or the SdKfz. 234 for reconnaissance roles, but there is documentation that shows there was often one Troop of M3 Stuarts being used in US cavalry reconnaissance squadrons, alongside 2-3 Troops of armoured cars. Now HoI4 does not have armoured cars, those being implied as being part of the recon support company or as part of mechanized troops.

Keeping all that in mind, I feel like light tanks could really use a little buff, so I decided to give them a little bit of recon and half the penalty they get in urban and forested areas.

[h1]What this mod does[/h1]
[list=1]
[*]Gives a little bit of recon to all light armoured tank variants.
[*]Halves the penalty in urban and forested areas for all light armoured tank variants.
[*]Reduces combat width of light SPAT and SPG by -1 each.
[*]Slightly reduces training time for all light armoured tank variants.
[/list]

I tried to make it balanced by using rather low stats, keeping in mind that the recon bonus is cumulative, meaning that 8 light tank battalions give a recon stat of 2 to the division. Is it actually balanced? I don't know. I did a playthrough with it and it seemed to be okay. But I might adjust the stats slightly if I feel it's too unbalanced later down the line.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
One of my aims of all my mods is always as much compatibility as possible.
I tried everything in my power to make it compatible with other mods, patches and such, but I could only get so far. At the very least, this mod is only incompatible with other mods that edit the light tank battalion and light self-propelled gun brigades, but it is compatible with every other type of mod. For example, it is compatible with my other mod [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=827398034]"Arty Upgrades for SPs"[/url], and also should work with mods such as Road to '56.

This mod is [u]not[/u] ironman compatible.

[h1]To-Do:[/h1][list]
[*]I might do a more extensive overhaul of the complete armoured tech-tree in the future, or light tank at the very least. I got some ideas bouncing around in my head and ways to implement them. I don't know if I'll add it to this mod or if I will branch it off into a mod of it's own. Either way, more light tank improvements will come. The biggest problem standing in the way of this is compatibility with other mods and how Clausewitz (seems) to load tech trees.
